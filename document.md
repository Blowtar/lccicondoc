# LCC Icon Set Documentation

Alongside this documentation you will find a folder named **AI Files**, this folder contains several LCC icon sets that can be edited. There is also a blank template named **Template - LCC Icon Set**, this can be used when creating a new set of icons. Each file contains around 60 artboards and each artboard will contain a single icon. 

If you find Adobe Illistator is running slow when using the template, feel free to delete several artboards until you have a smooth running application. This can be done by selecting the **Artboard Tool** from the tools menu (usually located on the far left), then selecting the artboard and pressing the **Back Space** botton the keyboard. This can also be achieved by opening the artboard menu (**Windows > Artboards**).
