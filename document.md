# LCC Icon Set Documentation

Alongside this documentation you will find a folder named **AI Files**, this folder contains several LCC icon sets that can be edited. There is also a blank template named **Template - LCC Icon Set**, this can be used when creating a new set of icons.

Each file contains around 60 artboards and each artboard will contain a single icon. If you find Adobe Illistator is running slow when using the template, feel free to delete several artboards until you have a smooth running application. This can be done by selecting the **Artboard Tool** from the tools menu, usually located on the far left of the screen.
